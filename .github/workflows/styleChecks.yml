          #disable whitespace/indent as we are using no indent before access modifiers and 4-space indent for code blocks, as opposed to google style guide's default
          #disable runtime/references as google's style guide has been updated to allow references as function parameters, but this is not reflected in cpplint yet
          #disable runtime/string as using global std::strings is sufficient for our case and more convenient in terms of memory management compared to C-style strings
          #disable build/c++11 because we only need to build for the C++17 :D
